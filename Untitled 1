Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?
A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, 
so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.
Though marker interfaces are still in use, they very likely point to a code smell and should be used carefully. The main reason for this is that they blur the lines about what an interface represents since markers don't define any behavior. 
Newer development favors annotations to solve some of the same problems.
